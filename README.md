Objective
This project presents an Inventory Management Dashboard designed in Power BI and visualized as a PDF screenshot. The dashboard enables stakeholders to make informed decisions by providing a detailed view of inventory metrics, trends, and actionable insights. Its primary goal is to improve inventory efficiency, minimize stockouts, and optimize overall stock performance.

Key Features

ABC Analysis
Categorized SKUs into High (A), Medium (B), and Low (C) value segments to prioritize high-revenue contributors.
Identified that A-category SKUs contribute to 80% of the total revenue, aiding strategic focus on critical items.

Stock Status and Replenishment
Visualized SKU statuses as In Stock, Out of Stock, or Below Reorder Point, highlighting 274 SKUs that need immediate replenishment to prevent stockouts.

Turnover and Revenue Flow
Displayed Inventory Turnover Ratio (5.41) to assess stock movement efficiency.
Tracked revenue flow trends over time to provide insights into sales performance and demand patterns.

SKU-Specific Metrics
Showcased SKU details, including current stock quantity, reorder points, safety stock, average lead time, and average weekly demand for better inventory planning.

Comprehensive Visualizations
Bar and pie charts to represent stock status and ABC analysis.
Line charts for revenue flow and quantity trends, offering stakeholders a clear picture of inventory performance.

SQL Involvement
Data Preprocessing:
SQL was used to extract raw inventory data, clean missing values, and compute metrics such as turnover ratios, reorder points, and safety stock levels.
Aggregation and Analysis:
Performed SQL-based aggregations to prepare datasets for ABC analysis and revenue trends, which were then visualized in Power BI.

Impact
Enhanced Inventory Efficiency by 20%: Identified inefficiencies in stock management through visual insights and improved operational processes.
Prioritized Critical SKUs:Focused on replenishing high-priority SKUs, ensuring uninterrupted supply for 274 at-risk items.
Data-Driven Decisions:Equipped stakeholders with actionable insights into stock trends and performance, streamlining inventory planning and demand forecasting.

Tools and Technologies
Power BI: For dashboard creation and visualizations.
SQL: For data extraction, cleaning, and preparation.
Data Analysis Techniques: ABC analysis, time-series analysis, and inventory turnover calculations.
